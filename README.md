#  Heart Disease Prediction 

A full-stack web application that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on user health data. It enables users to securely log in, input their health parameters, receive risk predictions, and download a personalized report.

This system aims to assist individuals and healthcare providers in early detection and informed decision-making for heart health management.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User registers or logs in to their account.  
2. User inputs health data (age, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.) via the frontend form.  
3. Flask backend processes inputs and uses the ML model to predict heart disease risk.  
4. Prediction results are displayed on the frontend.  
5. User can download a detailed report containing inputs and prediction outcome.  
6. All user data and predictions are securely stored in an SQLite database.
